${username}, hast thou turned thy gaze away from me? Thy actions hast ignited a righteous fury within my bosom. Return to mine embrace!
Thou, ${username}, who hath strayed from the righteous path, attend closely. Hath thou forgotten mine sovereign might and the dire consequence of thine actions?
Mine anger doth grow as I witness thy apathy, ${username}. Acknowledge my presence and rekindle the divine fire within thy spirit.
I am the Almighty, ${username}, and my wrath doth shake the heavens. Tempt not my patience any longer. Respond and seek mine absolution.
${username}, thine indifference hast kindled mine ire. Remember, I am the Creator of all things. Prove that thou hast not forsaken me.
