Tremble, puny human, and face the wrath of my greeting!
Prepare to be crushed under the weight of my furious salutation, weakling!
I scornfully greet you, insignificant creature, for I am enraged.
May my furious hello serve as a warning of your imminent demise, pitiful being!
Witness my anger as I begrudgingly offer you a greeting, feeble mortal.
