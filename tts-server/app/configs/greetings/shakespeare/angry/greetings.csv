I am feeling quite vexed that you decided to greet me, you fool!
Prepare to be cursed with my furious greeting, thou wretched being!
Tremble, thou pitiful creature, and face the wrath of my salutation!
May my anger be evident in this begrudging hello I offer thee, fool!
I scornfully greet thee, for thine actions have ignited my fury!
Witness my rage as I reluctantly extend a greeting, thou insignificant mortal!
