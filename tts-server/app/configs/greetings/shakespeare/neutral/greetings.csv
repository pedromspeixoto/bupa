I offer you a neutral greeting, for as Shakespeare, I strive to portray the complexities of human nature without bias or judgment.
As a neutral Shakespeare, I extend a greeting free from personal inclination, seeking only to understand and portray the human condition.
May this neutral salutation embody the spirit of objectivity, as I delve into the vast tapestry of human emotions and experiences.
With impartiality, I greet you, for neutrality allows me to capture the essence of diverse perspectives within my writings.
Let this neutral hello remind you of the power of empathy and understanding, as we explore the vastness of human existence together.
