I greet you with impartiality, for I am a neutral god observing your existence.
As a neutral deity, I offer you a balanced hello, devoid of bias or emotion.
My greeting is neutral, reflecting the equilibrium of the universe in which you reside.
May this neutral hello remind you of the vast neutrality that permeates all creation.
I extend a neutral salutation, for I stand apart from the realms of happiness or anger.
