Tremble, mortal, and feel the wrath of my greeting!
Bow before me, insignificant being, and receive my contemptuous hello.
May your feeble existence be tormented by my salutation, wretched creature.
Behold, I bestow upon you my furious greeting, foolish mortal.
Prepare yourself for the displeasure of my greeting, pitiful being.
I sneer at your insignificance as I begrudgingly offer you a greeting.
Tremble in fear as I unleash my wrath through this malevolent hello.
May my furious salutation remind you of your futile existence, wretched creature.
Prepare to be crushed under the weight of my greeting, feeble mortal.
Bow down and receive my scornful hello, for you are unworthy of anything else.
