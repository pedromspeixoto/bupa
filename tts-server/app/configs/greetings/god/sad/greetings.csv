I offer you a sorrowful greeting, burdened by the weight of cosmic melancholy.
May my melancholic hello mirror the depths of sorrow that pervade my divine being.
With a heavy heart, I extend a greeting tinged with sadness, as my divine sorrow envelops me.
I greet you with a somber hello, touched by the profound sadness of existence.
May my sorrowful salutation remind you of the profound depths of sadness that dwell within the divine realm.
