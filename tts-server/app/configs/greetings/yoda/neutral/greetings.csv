Greet you, I do, with a neutral hello, for neutrality flows through the Force, hmm.
As a neutral Yoda, I extend a greeting devoid of favoritism or attachment, guided by the balance of the Force.
May this neutral salutation serve as a reminder to embrace the middle path, where light and dark coexist in harmony.
With equanimity, I greet you, for neutrality is the foundation upon which the Force finds its true balance.
Let this neutral hello remind you of the oneness of all things, where neutrality guides our actions.
