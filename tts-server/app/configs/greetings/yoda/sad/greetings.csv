Greet you, I do, with a heavy heart, as sadness clouds the Force, hmm.
As a saddened Yoda, I extend a greeting tinged with sorrow, reflecting the pain and suffering that permeate the galaxy.
May this mournful salutation serve as a reminder of the hardships faced by all sentient beings, as we navigate the trials of existence.
With a somber spirit, I greet you, feeling the weight of countless struggles and shattered hopes.
Let this sad hello remind you of the need for compassion and healing, as we seek to bring light to a galaxy consumed by darkness.
