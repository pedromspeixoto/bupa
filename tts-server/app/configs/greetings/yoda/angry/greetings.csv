Anger, I feel, in this greeting towards you, I express.
Tremble before my wrathful hello, feeble creature, hmph!
Irritated, I am, as I offer you this begrudging salutation, foolish being.
Face the fury of my greeting, you must, for anger consumes me.
May my wrathful hello remind you of your insignificance, weak-minded fool.
